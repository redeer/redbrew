Arduino project for home brew

A very simple project about homebrew.
The Arduino sketch doese all what you need to brew an all grain beer, MASH, BOIL and FERMENTER.

The hardware used is all included in the Arduino starter kit, except the temperature probe and the static solid relay.
I used one temperature probe based on DS18B20 chip and 2 SSR Fotek ssr-25 DA. 

To boil the water and have it at a specified temperature I used a 30l stainless steel pot with a wasching machine resistenze and tap.
